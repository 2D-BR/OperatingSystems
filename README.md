 📊 CPU Scheduling Algorithms Simulator

This web-based educational tool allows users to visualize and understand the behavior of various **CPU scheduling algorithms** used in operating systems. It features interactive simulations of **FIFO**, **SJF**, **Priority**, and **Round Robin**, helping students and educators grasp core concepts in process scheduling.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧮 Simulation of four classic scheduling algorithms:
  - **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
  - **SJF (Shortest Job First)**
  - **Priority Scheduling**
  - **Round Robin**
- 🖱️ Interactive UI with navigation menu
- 📈 Visual representations of algorithm logic and behavior
- 💻 Lightweight: no backend, runs directly in the browser

Features

    FIFO (First In First Out) Scheduling: Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
    SJF (Shortest Job First) Scheduling: Processes with the shortest burst time are scheduled first.
    Priority Scheduling: Processes with the lowest priority are scheduled first.
    Round Robin Scheduling: Processes are scheduled in a cyclic order with a fixed time quantum.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Use the top navigation menu to explore each algorithm.
4. Click the buttons to enter simulation pages and visualize behavior.

> 💡 All simulations run client-side, so no installation or server is required.
